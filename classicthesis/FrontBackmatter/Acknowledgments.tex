\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
Many thanks go to Dr. ir. Djoerd Hiemstra of the University of Twente and to Sander Bockting Msc. of Avanade Netherlands BV for their great supervision throughout the project.

In addition I would like to thank all other graduate interns at Avanade as well as all the Avanade employees for the great talks at the coffee machine or elsewhere. In particular I owe many thanks to Michel Barneveld for giving me insight in potential applications of Learning-to-Rank within Avanade.
